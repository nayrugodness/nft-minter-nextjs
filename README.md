Nft Minter with Next Js is a personal project that allows you to mint your own Nft's

here you can see the transaction of the contract that you're Nft will use https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x7c0cbbf9127eb7c96b24dae92ba393bfe9232dd35596abab28d0ea01c69f9ee3

The tools that I use to create this platform are Moralis, Solidity and Next.js

To mint you're Nft you need to have Ropsten ETH and a metamask wallet
